# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This repository contains Weather Dashboard with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of my own. This app allows us to see weather outlook for multiple cities. When user searches for a city, app displays with current and future conditions for that city. Current conditions include the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. UV index presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Future conditions for the city include, 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
